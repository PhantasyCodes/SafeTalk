# SafeTalk
Safetalk is a android app for anonymous communication, with end-to-end encrypted chats.

## Background

In today's digital age, communication has evolved rapidly, and privacy concerns have become increasingly prevalent. While there are various messaging apps available, many users are seeking a platform that allows them to communicate anonymously and securely. This need has led to the development of Safetalk, an Android app designed to provide users with a secure and anonymous communication experience.

## Problem

* **Privacy concerns:** Many users are worried about their online privacy and are hesitant to share personal information on conventional messaging apps. They are concerned about data breaches, surveillance, and the potential misuse of their data.

* **Cyberbullying and Harassment:** Online harassment and cyberbullying have become significant issues. Users want a platform where they can express themselves without fear of being targeted or identified by malicious individuals.

* **Lack of Anonymity:** Existing messaging apps often require users to provide personal information, including phone numbers or email addresses, which compromises their anonymity.

* **Data Security:** Users want their messages and data to be stored securely, with end-to-end encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
