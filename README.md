# SafeTalk
Safetalk is a android app for anonymous communication, with end-to-end encrypted chats.

## Background

In today's digital age, communication has evolved rapidly, and privacy concerns have become increasingly prevalent. While there are various messaging apps available, many users are seeking a platform that allows them to communicate anonymously and securely. In the context of vulnerable and marginalized communities, as well as individuals who have experienced abuse or are struggling with addiction, the need for a safe and anonymous communication platform is even more critical. Recognizing this need, Safetalk was developed as an Android app dedicated to providing a secure, stigma-free space for these groups to connect, share, and seek guidance and counseling.

## Problem

* **Privacy concerns:** Many users are worried about their online privacy and are hesitant to share personal information on conventional messaging apps. They are concerned about data breaches, surveillance, and the potential misuse of their data.

* **Cyberbullying and Harassment:** Online harassment and cyberbullying have become significant issues. Users want a platform where they can express themselves without fear of being targeted or identified by malicious individuals.

* **Lack of Anonymity:** Existing messaging apps often require users to provide personal information, including phone numbers or email addresses, which compromises their anonymity.

* **Data Security:** Users want their messages and data to be stored securely, with end-to-end encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
