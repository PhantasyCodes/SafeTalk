# SafeTalk
Safetalk is a android app for anonymous communication, with end-to-end encrypted chats.

## Background

In today's digital age, communication has evolved rapidly, and privacy concerns have become increasingly prevalent. While there are various messaging apps available, many users are seeking a platform that allows them to communicate anonymously and securely. In the context of vulnerable and marginalized communities, as well as individuals who have experienced abuse or are struggling with addiction, the need for a safe and anonymous communication platform is even more critical. Recognizing this need, Safetalk was developed as an Android app dedicated to providing a secure, stigma-free space for these groups to connect, share, and seek guidance and counseling.

## Problem

* **Privacy concerns:** Many users are worried about their online privacy and are hesitant to share personal information on conventional messaging apps. They are concerned about data breaches, surveillance, and the potential misuse of their data.

* **Stigma and Isolation:** Vulnerable communities, abuse survivors, and addicts often face significant stigma and isolation when trying to discuss their experiences and seek support. They may be hesitant to open up due to fear of judgment and discrimination.

* **Lack of Anonymity:** Existing messaging apps often require users to provide personal information, including phone numbers or email addresses, which compromises their anonymity. Anonimity is of high importance in such an app as users will be sharing sensitive information about their personal lives.

* **Access to Guidance and Counseling:** Many individuals in these communities require professional guidance and counseling services, but they may not have easy access to these resources or may be afraid to seek help due to confidentiality concerns.
